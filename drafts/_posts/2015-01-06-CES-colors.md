This year like last year we will be present at <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">#CES2015</a> in Las Vegas. We share a booth with our sister company <a href="http://www.cityzensciences.fr/">Cityzen Sciences</a> which presents two products which include their smart fabric, namely a D-Shirt (Digital Shirt) and a pair of cycling shorts.

We will pitch our platform offering to the CES attendees but we also wanted them to be able to directly experience our service, and this is not something easy when your service is meant for developers. So instead of just describing use cases of some of our customers, we imagined an interactive experiment based on our platform. This experiment is called #color, it's both an online and physical experience. It's physical because we invite visitors on our booth to interact with a custom pod, pressing buttons here and there. Those interactions change the color of an orb on display on our booth, simple you may say... But there's a catch, the orb and the pod are not connected, instead they both interact with our platform, the pod pushes the selected color and the orb reads it and changes its color accordingly. This demonstrates how our platform can be used to simply control connected objects.

The online part enables you to visualize analytics on the colors that the CES attendees have selected. These analytics are made possible by the use of our data manipulation environment (named Einstein), since all selected colors are pushed onto our platform, they are all available for analysis. What's really interesting is that the whole process is simply an HTML5 page which interacts with the platform, absolutely no backend logic was necessary, thus demonstrating how easy it is to create services based on the data managed by the platform.

We hope that you can come and see for yourself how fun this demo is, if not you can look at the <a href="http://bit.ly/cescolor">analytics</a> to see what hues the CES crowd prefers.

After CES, <a href="http://twitter.com/lostinbrittany">Horacio</a> who has put this demo together will publish a report of the selected tones.
