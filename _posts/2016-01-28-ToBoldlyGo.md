It's been a little more than one year since we started this blog. During this time the platform we've been building since 2013 has continued to evolve, getting richer features as releases were made.

We've signed customers in many different fields and their appreciation of our technology has always been positive, thanking us for helping them solve hard problems so they can focus on their value creation.

In the mean time the landscape of platforms for the Internet of Things has evolved, with some solutions gaining momentum and becoming used for many different use cases. The more we looked at most of those solutions, the more we felt we were providing a better way of doing things. So in mid 2015 we started to think how we could open up our platform to a larger audience without cannibalizing our business. Our conclusion was that the best way to grow awareness about our technology was to change our distribution model and embrace open source for our core components.

So here were are, after lots of efforts of cleaning, packaging, documenting and legal work, we're thrilled to announce that the core of our offering, our platform for sensor data, is becoming open source. This won't change much the way we do business as we will continue to provide support contracts to our customers so they can deploy our platform without worrying about how to get help should they need it. We also continue to offer hosted solutions so you don't have to deploy it yourself. What will change is the number of people who will get their hands on what we've created, and that gets us really excited, as many of the problems they've been struggling to solve with other time series databases are easily addressed by our approach.

In this opening process we had to make a few changes, the major one was renaming the language we created to manipulate sensor data. That language was initially called Einstein because we thought Einstein was the best person capable of making sense of the spacetime continuum (our storage layer is still called continuum). But we realized that Einstein was a [global trademark](http://www.albert-einstein.org/gotocorbis.html) so we had to find another name to not infringe on this trademark. As our platform was called Warp, and now Warp 10, in reference to the top speed achievable, we renamed our language to WarpScript, which we tend to like since it finds its roots in PostScript for lots of aspects. We still kept the '.mc2' file extension as a reminder of the Einstein days. So don't be surprised if you read references to Einstein here or there, we're trying to move on but occasionaly our brains will make those odd references.

The project home is now [www.warp10.io](http://www.warp10.io/), and the code lies on Cityzen Data's [github account](https://github.com/cityzendata). We've also set up a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/warp10-users) and a twitter account [@warp10io](https://twitter.com/warp10io), so you have plenty of ways to reach out to us and the community we expect to build.

So on behalf of the team at Cityzen Data who has been working really hard those last few weeks, I wish you a very warm welcome to the Warp 10 universe, hoping your take our technology where no one has taken it before!
